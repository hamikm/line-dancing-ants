# Line Dancing Ants
## A hunt-and-gather simulation for simple, autonomous agents

TODO: insert GIF showcasing simulation

I was delighted to stumble across this project on an old external hard drive â€” I considered this code lost to time.

Back in the nineties and aughts, swarm engineering was a nascent discipline trying to build a theoretical
framework for deriving control algorithms for minimalistic, cooperating agents. In other words, it was like playing God
with robotic ants!

Swarm engineering simulations imposed harsh constraints on the environmental awareness of agents, like a small visibility
radius and low-bandwith communication, to model the physical constraints of sensors and of deployments in remote locations
where GPS might not be available. AFAIK the theory never quite panned out, but various groups developed some fun swarms to
solve interesting, general problems, like resource centralization. Ants, of course, are very good at that, but their
search-and-retrieve algorithm leans heavily on volatile chemicals called pheromones.

Creating a swarm that solves the same problem without pheromones is an interesting problem that I had the fortune to work
on during high school. This simulation is the result of that work.
